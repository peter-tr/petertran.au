fix Design Studio's AI generation UX: the draft overlay's yellow outline was hard to see against similarly-colored designs (now a high-contrast pink outline with a glow, visible regardless of the underlying palette); the Accept/Discard buttons were in the wrong order (Discard now sits left/secondary, Accept right/primary, matching standard dialog conventions); and the one-shot prompt form has been replaced with a persistent chat-style panel that stays open across generations, so a follow-up like "make it bigger" refines the current draft instead of starting over.

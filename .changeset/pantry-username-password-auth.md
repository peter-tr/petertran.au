fix(pantry): replace Cognito Hosted UI sign-in with an in-app email/password form - Hosted UI's authorization-code flow never actually completed in production because Cognito's `/oauth2/token` endpoint doesn't return CORS headers for a browser `fetch`. Sign-in/sign-up now call Cognito's IdP API directly with USER_PASSWORD_AUTH, with no email verification step and no MFA (a new pre-sign-up Lambda trigger auto-confirms accounts), and the header now shows an explicit "Sign out" label once signed in.
